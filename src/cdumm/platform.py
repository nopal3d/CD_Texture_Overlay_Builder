"""Platform abstraction layer.

Centralises the OS-specific decisions that the rest of the codebase
makes ad hoc, so adding a new platform is one file diff instead of
fifteen. CDUMM is a Windows app at heart — the Crimson Desert client is
Windows-only — but the manager itself runs natively on macOS and Linux
so users on Whisky / CrossOver / Wine can manage mods without booting
into the Wine prefix every time.

Three things this module owns:

1. ``app_data_dir()`` — the per-user state directory CDUMM writes to.
   Windows: ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\cdumm`` (i.e. ``~/AppData/Local/cdumm``).
   macOS:   ``~/Library/Application Support/cdumm``.
   Linux:   ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/cdumm`` (defaults to ``~/.local/share/cdumm``).

2. ``open_path(path)`` — the cross-platform replacement for
   ``os.startfile``. Hands a file or URL to whatever the user's OS
   considers the default opener (Explorer / Finder / xdg-open).

3. ``IS_WINDOWS`` / ``IS_MACOS`` / ``IS_LINUX`` flags so callers don't
   keep re-checking ``sys.platform`` strings.

Anything that touches the registry, the Win32 API, or NTFS-specific
behaviour stays guarded by ``IS_WINDOWS``. Anything that talks about
``bin64/CrimsonDesert.exe`` lives in the Wine prefix on macOS / Linux,
not on the host filesystem — but the Path object is the same shape
either way, so callers don't need to care.

    Historical: prior to v3.2 the path was hard-coded to
    ``Path.home() / "AppData" / "Local" / "cdumm"`` everywhere, which
    is a Windows-style path that happens to work as a regular folder
    on POSIX (Python's pathlib is happy with literal "AppData" as a
    directory name) — but stuffing app state into ``~/AppData`` on
    macOS and Linux is a faux pas, and on macOS it lives outside the

    Errors are caught and logged at WARNING level (with the failing
    path + the underlying OSError detail) so callers don't have to
    wrap each call in their own try/except. The previous version
    silently swallowed every exception, which lost the diagnostic
    detail the old ``os.startfile`` raise gave us — review feedback
    on PR #64 flagged that callers like ``mods_page._ctx_open_source``
    used to log the OSError message themselves and now show a
    generic "OS opener unavailable". Logging here at the source
    means every callsite gets free OSError detail in the user's log
    file without needing to change.

    On macOS and Linux this also handles ``steam://`` / ``nxm://`` URLs
    correctly because both ``open`` and ``xdg-open`` route URL schemes
